# This workflow is used to publish SV2 crates to crates.io
# the workflow tries to publish all the library crates by running scripts/release-libs.sh
# in case the `cargo publish` command fails, the script returns 1 and the entire workflow fails
# the only exception is when the `cargo publish` command fails because the crate has already
# been published, in which case the workflow continues
