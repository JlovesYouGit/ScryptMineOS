# Scrypt DOGE Mining System Architecture

## Overview

The Scrypt DOGE Mining System is a production-ready cryptocurrency mining solution designed for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) mining using the Scrypt algorithm. The system follows a modular, clean architecture with separation of concerns and implements advanced features for security, performance, and economic optimization.

## Data Flow

1. **System Initialization**
   - Main service loads configuration
   - Initializes all subsystems
   - Starts monitoring and security components

2. **Mining Workflow**
   - Connects to primary mining pool
   - Receives mining jobs from pool
   - Processes jobs using hardware interface
   - Submits shares back to pool
   - Monitors performance and profitability

3. **Failover Process**
   - Detects pool connection issues
   - Activates circuit breaker pattern
   - Attempts reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Fails over to backup pools if needed

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Collects system metrics continuously
   - Logs events and performance data
   - Sends alerts for critical issues
   - Tracks economic profitability
