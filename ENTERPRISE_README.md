## 🛠️ **INSTALLATION & SETUP**

### 1. **Environment Configuration**

Create your secure environment file:

```bash
# Copy the enterprise template
cp private/.env.enterprise .env

# Edit with your secure values
nano .env
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Creator wallet addresses (ENCRYPTED)
CREATOR_LTC_ADDRESS=your_creator_ltc_address
CREATOR_DOGE_ADDRESS=your_creator_doge_address

# Enterprise security
ENTERPRISE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_base64_encryption_key
ENTERPRISE_MASTER_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
SYSTEM_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token

# Database (if using)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 2. **Initialize Enterprise System**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run as creator (full access)
python enterprise_runner.py --user-id creator --creator-mode

# Run as regular user
python enterprise_runner.py --user-id your_user_id
```

### 3. **User Management**

```python
from enterprise.security.config_manager import get_config_manager

# Add new user (creator only)
config_manager = get_config_manager()
config_manager.add_user("user123", "John Doe", AccessLevel.USER, "creator")

# User can update their own wallet
config_manager.update_user_wallet("user123", "ltc", "ltc1q...", "user123")
```

---

## 🔐 **SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **File Access Control**

The system automatically restricts access to sensitive files:

```python
# Files hidden from non-creators:
- BYTEROVER_MCP_HANDBOOK*.md  # MCP configuration files
- AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md         # AI agent configurations  
- .env, .env.*               # Environment files
- enterprise/security/*       # Security modules
- private/*                  # Private data directory
- *.key, *.pem              # Cryptographic keys
```

### **Configuration Security**

All sensitive configuration is encrypted and access-controlled:

```python
# Creator-only access
MONGODB_URI, SYSTEM_ADMIN_TOKEN, CREATOR_WALLET_ADDRESSES

# User-configurable
WORKER_NAME, TARGET_HASHRATE, POWER_LIMIT

# Public access
POOL_HOSTS, POOL_PORTS, METRICS_PORT
```

### **Audit Logging**

Every access attempt is logged:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T14:56:06",
  "action": "get_config",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "details": "Retrieved LTC_POOL_HOST",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

---

## 💡 **USER WALLET MANAGEMENT**

### **For Users**

Users can only update their own wallet addresses:

```python
# Update your LTC address
config_manager.update_user_wallet("your_user_id", "ltc", "ltc1q...", "your_user_id")

# Update your DOGE address  
config_manager.update_user_wallet("your_user_id", "doge", "D...", "your_user_id")
```

### **For Creators**

Creators can manage all user wallets and system configuration:

```python
# Update any user's wallet (creator privilege)
config_manager.update_user_wallet("user123", "ltc", "ltc1q...", "creator")

# Access system configuration
mongodb_uri = config_manager.get_config("MONGODB_URI", "creator")
```

---

## 📈 **ENTERPRISE MONITORING**

### **Prometheus Metrics**

Access metrics at `http://localhost:9090/metrics`:

```
# Mining operations
mining_operations_total{operation="share_submit",status="accepted"} 1250

# Performance metrics  
current_hashrate_mhs 9500.0
power_consumption_watts 3350.0
current_profitability_usd_per_day 45.67

# System health
active_stratum_connections 2
```

### **Health Checks**

System health endpoint at `http://localhost:8081/health`:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 86400,
  "hashrate": 9500.0,
  "connections": 2,
  "profitability": 45.67,
  "last_share": "2025-01-09T14:55:30Z"
}
```
